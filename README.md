# Basic
 the basis of the type of variable present in a program, we determine the space that it occupies in storage, 
 along with the way in which the stored bit pattern will be interpreted.
 
1. Integer – We use these for storing various whole numbers, such as 5, 8, 67, 2390, etc.
2. Character – It refers to all ASCII character sets as well as the single alphabets, such as ‘x’, ‘Y’, etc.
3. Floating-point – These refer to all the real number values or decimal points, such as 40.1, 820.673, 5.9, etc.
